How to run the OSCAR climate model:

## Run with Poetry

If necessary, download and install:
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
- [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/)

Then, on a UNIX, macOS or Windows system run the commands:

```
git clone https://github.com/jamesmurdza/OSCAR.git
cd OSCAR
poetry run install
```

To run an example, run:
```
poetry run python run_scripts/basic_example_1.py
```
