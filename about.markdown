The goal of this website is to **make models of our society and planet open and accessible** through free software, clear instruction, and meaningful data visualizations.

What we do:

- 📄 Publish plain language guides on how to use scientific data and models
- 📉 Produce articles and visualizations
- 🐳 Containerize models to eliminate the hassle of installing new software

Possible Planets is founded on the philosophy that scientific models should be easy-to-use, open-source, and no more complicated than necessary. Only in this way can a sufficient number of people become educated on and aware of the science behind global challenges.
